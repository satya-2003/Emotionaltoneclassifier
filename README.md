# Emotional tone classifier

Multithreaded Emotional Tone Classifier is a Python-based desktop application designed to automatically analyze and classify user-generated text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments. The system uses a hybrid approach that combines traditional machine-learning techniques and deep-learning models, executed through a multithreaded architecture for improved performance and scalability. Text data is preprocessed in a dedicated thread to generate TF-IDF features for a Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model and tokenized sequences for a PyTorch-based bidirectional LSTM model, both trained and evaluated in parallel. An interactive Tkinter GUI presents classification reports, accuracy comparisons, confusion matrices, and sample predictions, enabling users to compare model behavior and results effectively. The application supports CSV-based data processing and generates structured sentiment predictions, making it a complete end-to-end solution for efficient emotional tone analysis in real-world text analytics workflows.
